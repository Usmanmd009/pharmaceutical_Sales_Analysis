    "#### Correlation Matrix\n",
    "----------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantity and Sales (0.889): A strong positive correlation, meaning that as quantity increases, sales tend to increase significantly.\n",
    "Price and Sales (0.083): A weak positive correlation, indicating that price has little to no influence on sales. Quantity and Price (-0.001): Almost no relationship between quantity and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Regression Summary\n",
    "------------------------\n",
    "This analysis predicts sales using quantity and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### R-squared (0.798)\n",
    "\n",
    "79.8% of the variation in sales is explained by the model using quantity and price. This is a strong indication that the model fits the data well.\n",
    "Coefficients (coef):\n",
    "\n",
    "const (-45,710): The baseline sales value when both quantity and price are zero (not meaningful in practice but part of the model).\n",
    "Quantity (405.35): For every 1-unit increase in quantity, sales increase by about 405 units, assuming price remains constant.\n",
    "Price (112.43): For every 1-unit increase in price, sales increase by about 112 units, assuming quantity remains constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### P-values (P>|t|)\n",
    "\n",
    "For both quantity and price, the p-values are 0.000, meaning their effects on sales are statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### F-statistic (5.022e+05) and Prob(F-statistic)\n",
    "\n",
    "This tests whether the model is statistically significant overall. The very low probability (0.00) indicates that the model as a whole is meaningful.\n",
    "Key Observations\n",
    "Quantity is the strongest driver of sales: The high correlation and large coefficient show that sales are heavily influenced by the quantity sold.\n",
    "Price has a weaker effect: Though statistically significant, the effect of price on sales is much smaller compared to quantity.\n",
    "Model strength: With an R-squared of 79.8%, the model explains most of the variation in sales, which is a good sign of reliability.\n",
    "Let me know if you'd like to delve deeper into any specific part!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Recommendations\n",
    "---------------------\n",
    "Based on the statistical report, here are business recommendations to optimize sales performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Focus on Increasing Quantity Sold: \n",
    "Quantity has the strongest influence on sales (high correlation and coefficient) by offer discounts or promotions for customers buying in larger quantities. Bundle products to encourage higher volume purchases. Distrubution channels should be expanded to increase availability through partnerships with retailers or online platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Be Cautious with Price Adjustments:  Price has a statistically significant but weak effect on sales (low correlation and smaller coefficient). Large price increases might not significantly increase sales but could reduce customer satisfaction. Experiment with small price adjustments to find the sweet spot for profitability without affecting demand. Focus on marketing that highlights product value, which could make customers more price-insensitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use Quantity to Drive Sales Growth: \n",
    "Increasing quantity sold has a larger impact on sales compared to raising prices. Ensure popular products are always in stock to meet demand. Equip sales teams with strategies to upsell and increase order sizes. Run campaigns during high-demand seasons to maximize sales volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Invest in Data-Driven Sales Strategies: \n",
    "The high R-squared (79.8%) suggests the model can predict sales effectively. Use historical data to forecast sales and adjust inventory accordingly. Use the model to identify customer segments likely to purchase higher quantities and target them with specific offers. Consider analyzing additional variables (e.g., customer demographics or product features) to further improve sales predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Monitor Operational Efficiency: \n",
    "Quantity and price are key drivers, but operational inefficiencies could negate their impact. Ensure the ability to deliver large quantities efficiently. Regularly review pricing strategies to ensure they remain competitive while maximizing profitability."
