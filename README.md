## Conclusions And Recommendations

1. Understand your products inside and out: mechanism of action,
     clinical data, benefits, side effects, and comparisons with competitors.

2. Be prepared to discuss new research, updates, or relevant guidelines to stay 
     credible.

3. Segment your customers: Know which doctors, healthcare professionals (HCPs), 
     and hospitals need your products the most.

4. Apportion incentives: some distributors sales are low, there is need to look into
      and see how to  boost sales in that region

5. Sub channel evaluation: Government institution sales sub-channel should be
  selling more since governmental institutions have larger patients than other outlets. 
  More sales outlets could be set up to bring drugs closers to patients.
